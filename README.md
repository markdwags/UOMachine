UO Machine is a scripting utility for Ultima Online.  Scripts are
written in C# and execute as native code.

Supported clients:

All Mondain's Legacy/Stygian Abyss 2D clients.

How to write scripts:

It's recommended to use the included Visual Studio or SharpDevelop templates
to take advantage of code completion and refactoring features of
the IDE.  Don't forget to add a reference to UOMachine.exe in your project.

A GUI template is also included so that you can use the Visual Studio
form designer to easily create a GUI script.
